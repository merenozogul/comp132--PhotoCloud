# comp132--PhotoCloud

I developped this project for the course Comp 132. In this project, we should be designing a photo editing app.  
Users sould be able to change their personal information, share photo, like and dislike a shared photo, put a   
comment on a shared photo. There are 4 different types of users. Hobbiest, Free, Pro, Administrator. The amount  
of available filters is different in each user type. While doing the project I added additional features such as:  
-Button sounds when clicked  
-Messaging interface  
-Different backgrounds for different users  

Anyone who wishes to try the app can download the repository, run the main class, and sign up to PhotoCloud.
